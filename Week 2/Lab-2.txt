Lab 2

The aim of this practical is to refresh your knowledge of classes and objects.

Write an application that processes and displays simple information about students. Suppose student attributes are name, student ID, and three exam marks. Create a Student class (example below) with these attributes and include at least one method for processing the data attributes (e.g., calculating average exam score). The program should easily coup with any number of students and should allow modifying and adding student information.

To start with your program, you have two partially written classes (below).
// in the Student class
public class Student {
  private String name, id;      // private instance variables - accessed only within this class
  private int [] score = new int[3]; // score[] is an array of three integers for the exam marks
  // Constructor (default)
  public Student( )
  {
  }
  // Constructor (to initialise the name, the id, and the exam marks)
  public Student( String stName, String stID, int stScore[])
  {
/* Assign the name, ID, and the exam scores from the formal parameters 
    to the class instance variables here */
//[WRITE CODE HERE]
  }

   // Modifier methods
   public void setName( String nameIn)	// to modify the student name
   {
//[WRITE CODE HERE]
   }
	// ...
// Access methods
   public String  getName ( )  		// to access the student name
  {
//[WRITE CODE HERE]
  }

  // Calculates the average score
    public double avScore( )		// calculate the total and divide it by 3
    { 
//[WRITE CODE HERE]
    }

// Displays the student data attributes
    public void printOut( )
    { 
//[WRITE CODE HERE]
    }
}	// end of class Student

//in the Main class (to test class Student) 
public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) 
  { 
//Create two student objects stud1 and stud2 here
	
//[WRITE CODE HERE]
//Display information for the two objects
 stud1.printOut( );
stud2.printOut( );

//Create third student object stud3 here
//[WRITE CODE HERE]
	// change object id
	// change object name
	// change object exam scores

stud3.printOut();

// Find out which student is with the highest average score 
//[WRITE CODE HERE]

//Display his/her details here
//[WRITE CODE HERE]
 }	// end of class

When you are ready with your source code, use the material from your previous practical (Lab1) to set up a project and to build and run your application (or start with creating a project and adding the classes).
Donâ€™t forget to put each class in a separate file and all classes in the same package of your project.
If you run the application successfully and you still have time, then modify the main class to output info about the student with best/worst average exam results.
If you experience any problems with these simple classes, it means you have to put additional time and effort in order to get to the Java level covered in the previous year.
I have prepared a sample code for you, but please take a look at it only after you created your own code.
