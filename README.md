# University - Advanced Programming Concepts

This is a repo for all Java programming projects
completed within my ADPROG module.

This module will contain:

1. All in-classes examples
2. Practical Session Code
3. Coursework

There may be duplicate files of some classes, this is due to the topics being taught for a certain week. 
We may cover programming concepts that can be added to previous projects or that are needed for new teaching weeks :) 

## Week 1
* To develop good design and coding practices using object oriented (OO) approach (classes and objects).
* To develop OO design from a requirements statement using UML (Unified Modelling Language).
* To have practical understanding of a modern integrated development environment (NetBeans IDE).
* To understand OO design and programming techniques such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism (overloading, overriding) and their implementation in problem solving using Java.

## Week 2
* Object instantiation
* Object references
* Passing parameters between methods

## Week 3
* UML Notation and Representation
* Structure and Behaviour Diagrams 
    * Class and Use Case Diagrams
    * Object and Activity Diagrams
    * Component and Interaction Diagrams
